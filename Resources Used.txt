For the interface portion of the project, I used the following resources:

IntelliJ (IDE)
	JetBrains offers a free license to IntelliJ "Ultimate" to students. In this version exists
	lots of useful features for databases connections. Using the "Database" tab on the right
	edge of the screen, a user can connect directly to their various databases. I used this feature
	to connect to the Oracle database we used, giving me easier access to queries where I could check
	if updates to the tables were performed, etc.

JavaFX Scene Builder 2.0
	Scene Builder offers both an IDE integrated (in our case, IntelliJ) and standalone interface options.
	Using Scene Builder allows a user to drag and drop JavaFXML objects onto the screen, and directly see
	the effects they apply to the elements without needing to constantly compile. Not only this, but it
	creates the sample.fxml file for you dynamically as you build the interface.

StackOverflow
	As countless know, most issues a programmer can run into are already solved on this site, and I referenced
	it whenever necessary.

OracleDocs
	For any syntax issues, or imports.
